Solution Notes
====
 
In JS, everything is broken out into individual functions (perhaps more than
necessary) but the goal is to keep everything readable. Doing so also 
would help students to identify the pattern -- while the result is a higher
number of lines of code, the underlying structure in the formSubmitted
handler is easy to see, and should serve well for walking students through
the logical flow of what happens
 
Students should have pre-existing solutions they use for checking valid
emails and phone numbers (presumably not regex based).
